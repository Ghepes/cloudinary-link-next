# Cloudinary signed upload examples

This code demonstrates two ways of performing a signed upload to Cloudinary from the browser, using a server to create the signature. One uses Cloudinary's upload widget, the other uses a standard HTML form.

* Files specific to signed upload using Cloudinary's upload widget:
  * modules/signuploadwidget.js
  * public/uploadwidget.html
  * public/js/uploadclientwidget.js
  * routes/signuploadwidget.js
* Files specific to signed upload using a standard HTML form:
  * modules/signuploadform.js
  * public/uploadform.html
  * public/js/uploadclientform.js
  * routes/signuploadform.js
